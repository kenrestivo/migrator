# Migrator

A utility to migrate [Hubzilla](https://github.com/redmatrix/hubzilla) hubs from one server to another, and to migrate Redmatrix hubs to Hubzilla.

## Status

Pre-alpha, still work in progress

## Requirements

- A Hubzilla/Redmatrix hub with the most recent version of the [Migrator Plugin](https://github.com/kenrestivo/migrator-plugin) installed, enabled, and correctly configured, and the most recent version of Hubzilla.
- A Hubzilla hub into which you want to put the new accounts, with the most recent version of the [Migrator Plugin](https://github.com/kenrestivo/migrator-plugin) installed, enabled, and correctly configured, and the most recent version of Hubzilla.
- An admin account user login and password on both the old and new server (they don't have to be the same accont or credentials at all).
- Java Runtime (OpenJDK or similar)
- A couple hundred MB of RAM (probably not good to run on a VPS).
- Disk space for all the files
- Good reliable fast internet access to both the old and new server
- Time and patience


## Preparing for migration

1. Assure you have met the requirements as above
2. Delete or expire any accounts from the old server that you don't want to migrate.
